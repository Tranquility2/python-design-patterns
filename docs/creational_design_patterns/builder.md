# **Builder Design Pattern**

Providing a step-by-step approach to build complex objects effortlessly

> In essence, the builder Design Pattern simplifies and organizes the creation of complex objects, offering a step-by-step approach with flexibility and clarity. It's like having a skilled architect guide you through building your perfect object, brick by brick.

## Review

1. Builder class: Defines the steps for building the product, often with specific methods for each stage.
2. Client interaction: You call the builder methods in sequence, specifying the desired features and configurations.
3. Step-by-step construction: The builder internally manages the assembly process, ensuring proper order and compatibility.
4. Product creation: At the end, the builder returns the completed product, ready for use.

## Benefits

* **Improved readability**
  Separates construction logic from the product itself, making code clearer and easier to understand.
* **Flexibility**
  Allows customization by choosing different builder steps and configurations.
* **Immutability**
  Ensures the final product is immutable, reducing side effects and potential errors.
* **Chainable calls**
  Builder methods can be chained for a smooth and intuitive construction process.

## Example

```python
class Product:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parts = []

    def add(self, part):
        self.parts.append(part)

    def list_parts(self):
        print("Product parts:")
        for part in self.parts:
            print(part)

class Builder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.product = Product()

    def build_part_a(self):
        self.product.add("Part A")
        return self  # Allow chaining

    def build_part_b(self):
        self.product.add("Part B")
        return self  # Allow chaining

    def build_part_c(self):
        self.product.add("Part C")
        return self  # Allow chaining

    def get_product(self):
        return self.product

# Client code
builder = Builder()
product = builder.build_part_a().build_part_c().get_product()  # Chaining calls
product.list_parts()  # Output:
# Product parts:
# Part A
# Part C
```

## Remember

* Use the builder pattern for creating complex objects with multiple configurable options.
* Overuse can lead to boilerplate code and unnecessary complexity for simpler objects.
* Choose clear and descriptive builder method names for intuitive usage.
