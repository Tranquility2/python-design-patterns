<h1>Single Responsibility Principle</h1>
<p>Keeping Your Code Focused and Clean</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In essence, the Single Responsibility Principle encourages you to keep your code focused and organized, like a skilled juggler mastering one trick at a time. This leads to cleaner, more maintainable, and ultimately more reliable software.</p>

<h2 id="how-srp-works">How SRP works</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify the core responsibility of each class. What is the one thing it does best and why?</li>
<li>Isolate other functionalities into separate classes. If a class has multiple unrelated responsibilities, extract them into dedicated classes with their own reasons to change.</li>
<li>Minimize dependencies between classes. Classes should rely on each other only as much as necessary to fulfill their individual responsibilities.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="slide section level1">

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved code clarity</strong> Classes with focused responsibilities are easier to understand and maintain.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced complexity</strong> Simplifies reasoning about code and its potential impact.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced modularity</strong> Independent classes make code more reusable and adaptable.</li>
<li><strong>Increased testability</strong> Focused classes are easier to isolate and test effectively.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide section level1">

<h2 id="remember">Remember</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use SRP when you have classes with multiple, unrelated functionalities.</li>
<li>Overuse can lead to unnecessary code fragmentation and complexity for simple tasks.</li>
<li>Choose clear and descriptive names for classes and their responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
