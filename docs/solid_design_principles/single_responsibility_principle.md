# Single Responsibility Principle

Keeping Your Code Focused and Clean

> In essence, the Single Responsibility Principle encourages you to keep your code focused and organized, like a skilled juggler mastering one trick at a time. This leads to cleaner, more maintainable, and ultimately more reliable software.

## How SRP works

1. Identify the core responsibility of each class. What is the one thing it does best and why?
2. Isolate other functionalities into separate classes. If a class has multiple unrelated responsibilities, extract them into dedicated classes with their own reasons to change.
3. Minimize dependencies between classes. Classes should rely on each other only as much as necessary to fulfill their individual responsibilities.

## Benefits

* **Improved code clarity**
  Classes with focused responsibilities are easier to understand and maintain.
* **Reduced complexity**
  Simplifies reasoning about code and its potential impact.
* **Enhanced modularity**
  Independent classes make code more reusable and adaptable.
* **Increased testability**
  Focused classes are easier to isolate and test effectively.

## Remember

* Use SRP when you have classes with multiple, unrelated functionalities.
* Overuse can lead to unnecessary code fragmentation and complexity for simple tasks.
* Choose clear and descriptive names for classes and their responsibilities.
