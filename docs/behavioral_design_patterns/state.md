Adapting with Every Change

> In essence, the State Design Pattern allows your code to be like a chameleon, seamlessly blending in with the ever-changing conditions, adapting its behavior with each shift in its internal state. This promotes clarity, maintainability, and flexibility, making your program a master of adaptability.

---

## Workflow

1. Define an interface for the "state" (the configuration). This specifies the methods the state needs to implement for handling interactions and transitions.
2. Create concrete state classes. Each class implements the interface and defines the specific behavior and data associated with a particular state.
3. The main program has a "context" object. This object holds the current state and delegates interaction and transition requests to the chosen state.
4. Events or conditions can trigger state transitions. The context checks these triggers and, if necessary, switches to a new state, replacing the old one.

## Benefits

* **Improved clarity**
  Code for each state is encapsulated and easier to understand.
* **Enhanced maintainability**
  Changes in one state don't affect others, simplifying updates.
* **Centralized control**
  State transitions are managed in one place, promoting consistency.
* **Flexibility**
  New states can be added easily without modifying existing code.

## Example

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class DocumentState(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def key_pressed(self, key):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def save_request(self):
        pass

class EditingState(DocumentState):
    def key_pressed(self, key):
        print("Typing character:", key)

    def save_request(self):
        print("Saving document...")

class FormattingState(DocumentState):
    def key_pressed(self, key):
        print("Applying formatting:", key)

    def save_request(self):
        print("Formatting not allowed in this state.")

class DocumentContext:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = EditingState()  # Default state

    def handle_event(self, event):
        self.state.handle_event(event)

# Client code using the State pattern
context = DocumentContext()
context.handle_event("key_pressed", "a")  # Output: Typing character: a
context.handle_event("save_request")  # Output: Saving document...

context.state = FormattingState()
context.handle_event("key_pressed", "b")  # Output: Applying formatting: b
context.handle_event("save_request")  # Output: Formatting not allowed in this state.

```

## Remember

* Use the State pattern when your program's behavior needs to change dramatically based on its internal conditions.
* Overuse can lead to complex state hierarchies for simple logic and unnecessary abstractions.
* Clearly define the state interface and responsibilities of both the state classes and the context object.
